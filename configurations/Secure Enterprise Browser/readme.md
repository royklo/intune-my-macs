# Secure Enterprise Browser Configuration for Microsoft Edge

This directory contains three progressive security levels of Microsoft Edge browser configuration policies for macOS devices, designed to meet varying enterprise security requirements.

## 📦 Contents

The `Secure Enterprise Browser.zip` file contains three complete policy packages:

- **Level 1 - Basic Security** (22 settings)
- **Level 2 - Enhanced Security** (33 settings)  
- **Level 3 - High Security** (53 settings)

Each policy package includes:
- JSON configuration file (`pol-app-10X-edge-levelX.json`)
- XML manifest file (`pol-app-10X-edge-levelX.xml`)

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Extract the Policies

Unzip the `Secure Enterprise Browser.zip` file:

```bash
unzip "Secure Enterprise Browser.zip"
```

### Step 2: Select Your Security Level

Choose **ONE** of the three security levels based on your organization's requirements. Copy both the JSON and XML files for your chosen level to the repository root or your deployment folder.

**Important:** Only include ONE level at a time. Do not mix multiple levels.

### Step 3: Deploy with mainScript.ps1

Run the main deployment script from the repository root:

```powershell
pwsh ./mainScript.ps1 --assign-group="your-security-group"
```

The script will automatically discover and deploy the Edge browser policy you've included.

## � How Microsoft Edge updates (not via MAU)

Microsoft Edge for macOS **does not update through Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU)**. MAU
(`com.microsoft.autoupdate2`) services Office and other Microsoft apps such as Company
Portal, Teams, and Defender — but **not** Edge.

Edge ships and updates its own dedicated updater, **Microsoft Edge Update**
(`EdgeUpdater`, bundle ID `com.microsoft.EdgeUpdater`), which runs independently of MAU.
These browser policies configure Edge behaviour only; they do not change the update
channel. Keep the two mental models separate:

| App | Updater | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Microsoft Edge | Microsoft Edge Update (`EdgeUpdater`) | Self-contained; installed alongside Edge. Managed via Edge update policies, not MAU. |
| Office, Company Portal, Teams, Defender | Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) | Office-family updater. Does **not** update Edge. |

The bundled installer script [`scripts/intune/scr-app-101-install-edge.sh`](../../scripts/intune/scr-app-101-install-edge.sh)
sets `autoUpdate="true"`, meaning once Edge is installed it keeps itself current through
`EdgeUpdater` and the script will not attempt to re-deploy it.

## 📋 Selection Guidelines

### Choose Level 1 if:
- ✅ Standard corporate environment
- ✅ Productivity is primary concern
- ✅ Users need flexibility
- ✅ Low regulatory requirements
- ✅ General business operations

### Choose Level 2 if:
- ✅ Compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOX)
- ✅ Sensitive data handling
- ✅ Balanced security and productivity
- ✅ Regulated industry
- ✅ Professional services

### Choose Level 3 if:
- ✅ High-security requirements (CMMC, FedRAMP, DoD)
- ✅ Classified or highly sensitive data
- ✅ Known threat actors targeting organization
- ✅ Zero-trust security mandate
- ✅ Maximum security over convenience
- ✅ Critical infrastructure or government operations

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Single Level Only:** Deploy only ONE security level per device group. Mixing levels will cause conflicts.

2. **Testing Required:** Always test in a pilot group before broad deployment, especially for Level 2 and Level 3.

3. **User Impact:** Higher security levels progressively restrict browser functionality. Communicate changes to users.

4. **Compatibility:** All policies require Microsoft Edge version 90 or later on macOS 11.0+.

5. **Updates:** Review and update policies quarterly to align with new Edge features and security recommendations.

## 🔧 Customization

Each JSON policy can be customized by:

1. Extracting the desired level from the ZIP
2. Editing the JSON file to modify settings
3. Updating the `<SettingsCount>` in the XML manifest if you add/remove settings
4. Deploying via `mainScript.ps1`

## Script to download and set Desktop Wallpaper
##
## On macOS 14+ (Sonoma/Sequoia/Tahoe), simply replacing the image file on disk no longer
## triggers a wallpaper refresh. This script downloads the image and actively sets it as
## the desktop picture for the currently logged-in user via AppleScript.
##
## Requirements:
##   - Deploy the accompanying PPPC profile (cfg-sys-100-wallpaper-pppc.mobileconfig) via
##     Intune to pre-authorize osascript -> Finder Apple Events. Without this, a TCC
##     consent dialog will appear on the user's screen.
##   - Optionally deploy wallpaper.mobileconfig as a fallback for the override-picture-path.
